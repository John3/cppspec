C++Spec is a behavior-driven development library for C++ with an RSpec-inspired DSL.

## Installation ##

C++Spec is available as a single collated header-file that can be placed in any include path in your project. After that, all features are available via `#include "cppspec.hpp"`.

## Documentation ##

See [http://cppspec.readthedocs.org/]() for all documentation.

## Testing ##

## Requirements ##

C++Spec requires a compiler with support for C++11 and polymorphic lambda expressions from C++14. This includes GCC >= 4.9, MSVCC >= 14.0, or clang >= 3.4. For other compilers check [this chart](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/compiler_support).

__Note:__ Only the tests require being compiled with C++14 support (`-std=c++14`). No other part of an existing project's build must be modified.
