## Overview ##

C++Spec is a behavior-driven development library for C++ with an RSpec-inspired DSL. Designed with ease of use and rapid prototyping in mind, C++Spec offers an alternative to traditional testing libraries and frameworks.

Also see the [official GitHub pages site](http://toroidal-code.github.io/cppspec/) for more 
information.

## Installing ##

Either run `git clone https://github.com/toroidal-code/cppspec.git` or download the collated header
file (if it is available). You can also download a ZIP version of the repo.

If you want to manually generate the collated `cppspec.hpp`, you can download the ccollate tool [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/toroidal-code/ccollate/master/ccollate.rb) and then run `./ccollate.rb` in the toplevel directory of the C++Spec repo.
